This Java code demonstrates a straightforward implementation of a bank system and consists of the following classes:
BankAccount: This is the fundamental class that represents a bank account and includes all of its operations, including deposits and withdrawals. AccountNumber and balance are two instance variables with associated getter methods.
SavingsAccount: This class, which represents a savings account, extends the BankAccount class. It also contains a getter function for the extra instance variable interestRate. Additionally, it contains a method called addInterest that computes and deposits interest on the balance.
CurrentAccount: This class, which represents a current account, extends the BankAccount class as well. It also contains a getter function and an extra instance variable called overdraftLimit. This class's withdraw method has been modified to determine whether the requested amount exceeds the balance + the overdraft limit and to reject the transaction if it does.
A list of BankAccount objects may be found in the class Bank, which represents a bank. It offers ways to add accounts, locate accounts using account numbers, deposit money into accounts, and withdraw money from accounts.
Each class uses polymorphism, encapsulation, and inheritance in accordance with the principles of object-oriented programming.
